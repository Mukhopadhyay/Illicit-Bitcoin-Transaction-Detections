# Illicit-Bitcoin-Transaction-Detections
Training a Graph Neural Network to detect illicit bitcoin transactions

#### About Dataset

I am using the [Elliptic Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set) for this project. 
This data set is a transaction graph collected from the Bitcoin blockchain. 
- The nodes in the graph represents a trasaction (203,769 nodes).
- The edges determine the flow of transactions (234,355 edges).
- Every node has 166 features associated with it.
- Every node is labelled into "licit", "illicit" or "unknown".
- 2% are labelled as "ilicit", 21% are labelled as "licit", rest as "unknown".
